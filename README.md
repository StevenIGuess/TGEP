# TheGameEngineProject
The Official GitHub repo for the "GameEngineProject"

## What and Why?
This is an GameEngine, that was created for the development of small games using Opengl & C++.
Most of the code comes from the Hazel game engine tutorial series or the learnopengl website.

## Used libraries
I'm planning on not using too many libraries, but for the sake of simplicity, I'll still be using the following libraries: 
- Spdlog
- Assimp
- Glm
- Glfw
- Glad

These Libraries will (hopefully) later be replaced or removed.
