# TheGameEngineProject
The Official GitHub repo for the "GameEngineProject"

## What and Why?
This is and GameEngine from an Indie dev, that was created for the development of small Games using Opengl & C++

## Used libraries
I'm planning on not using too many libraries, but for the sake of simplicity, I'll be using the following libraries: 
- Spdlog

These Libraries will (hopefully) later be replaced or removed.
